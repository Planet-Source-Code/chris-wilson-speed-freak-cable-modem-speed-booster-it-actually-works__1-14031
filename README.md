## Speed Freak \(cable modem speed booster\) It Actually Works


</div>

### Description

What this code actually does is configure any system with a cable modem that is running windows 95/98/Me to run atleast 50% faster than before. This is not only my first submission to PSC but its also my first program in visual basic. So feel free edit it anyway you want but please send me a copy of what you have done so I can check it out :) I would check my speed on a site like http://bandwidthconnection.com/speedtest.html to see what your difference in speed was from the before and after. Hey if it helped and you like it give me a good rating. That does wonders for my self image :P
